   abstract = {We study an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game on a scale-free network by a modified Fermi updating rule, where each player is assigned an inertia index that controls its learning activity. An interesting finding is that the cooperation level can be significantly improved when the individual inertia is introduced. More importantly, a parameter beta is also introduced to control the diversity level of inertia among the individuals. It is found that there exists an optimal value of beta leading to the highest cooperation level. The observed results are explained by the feedback mechanism and the characteristic of the Fermi function. Our analysis also reveals that the players with moderate degrees play a critical role in the evolution of the whole system. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2010},

   abstract = {Male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) often cooperate with their neighbours. in defending nests against predators. Some studies have suggested that this is an example of by-product mutualism, whereas others have suggested the possibility of reciprocal altruism. No study has addressed the possibility of kin-selected cooperation in nest defence in this species. Reciprocal altruism, kin selection and by-product mutualism are not mutually exclusive alternatives, but few studies of territorial neighbours have tested for multiple mechanisms simultaneously. We test for these three possibilities in a population of red-winged blackbirds. We used simulated defections to test for reciprocal altruism. We used analysis of microsatellite loci to test for kin selection between adult male neighbours. We also used microsatellite loci to test for by-product mutualism resulting from nest defence of offspring sired on neighbouring territories. We found that male red-winged blackbirds cooperate in nest defence primarily as a form of reciprocal altruism. Experimental males reduced their level of nest defence relative to controls following simulated defection by a neighbour. In contrast to some earlier studies, we found no evidence for by-product mutualism: males did not defend nests where they had sired extra-pair offspring. We also found no evidence for kin selection: males were no more cooperative with more closely related neighbours. Considered alongside the results from other studies, our study suggests that mechanisms stabilizing cooperation in red-winged blackbirds may vary among populations.},

   abstract = {In many species, territorial neighbours fight to establish their mutual border and then develop a truce, known as the dear-enemy phenomenon, characterized by reduced vigilance and aggression along the border. We present evidence that among male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) the dear-enemy relationship is a form of reciprocal conditional cooperation that is stabilized, at least in part, by retaliation against cheaters. Simulated intrusions by randomly chosen neighbours were punished by a targeted increase in vigilance and aggression that persists for days. We interpret this increase in vigilance towards trespassers as a manifestation of distrust. The conditional decrease in vigilance and aggression is tempered by each neighbour's probability of cuckolding the focal male. Male red-winged blackbirds maintained greater vigilance and aggression towards sexually attractive neighbours that were more successful at extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs). It is unlikely that males directly observed neighbours copulating with their mates. They were more likely to assess a neighbour's ability to achieve extra-pair copulations using surrogate cues that correlate with success at EPFs, including body size. Our results suggest that red-winged blackbirds use rules that incorporate their neighbour's behaviour and quality in their territorial interactions with one another. Our results expand our understanding of cooperation for animals and for humans as well.},
